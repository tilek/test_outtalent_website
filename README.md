### Who are we?

We are a company called Outtalent founded by 
- Tilek Mamutov ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/tilek) // [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilek))
- Meder Mamutov ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/mederinho10) // [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamutov))

We help great software engineers from countries like Russia get jobs abroad in companies like Google.
You pay only if you get a high-paying job abroad.

### Why did we create Outtalent?

Tilek worked a software engineer in Kyrgyzstan when in 2006 he received an email asking whether he is interested in applying to Google. He was so surprised he thought it was a scam. It turned out to be real and getting a job and moving to Ireland was life-changing. He ended up working at Google and Google X for 11 years and in 2019 decided to team up with Meder to help other engineers in emerging markets achieve similar career goals.
